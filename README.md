# PRAWN

### (personal + cron) * crustacean = prawn

The idea is that prawn serves to remind you to do the occasional (non-habitual) tasks that one would otherwise often forget.

The NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) recommends testing smoke alarms once a month. When was the last time you remembered to test yours?
